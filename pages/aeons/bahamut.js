              Bahamut is a large, black dragon with enormous red wings. He can
              stand or move in either two legs or four. Unlike the other aeons,
              the king of dragons is heralded by multiple magic circles that
              appear in the heavens whenever he is summoned into being. His
              fayth is a young boy who guides Tidus throughout Spira. This boy
              revealed the truth about Tidus and his hometowns's origin. He also
              informed Tidus that he was brought to Spira to defeat Sin for
              good, and end the cycle of death. Only Tidus and Yuna can see the
              boy. The symbol for Bahamut and Bevelle is annotated with the
              kanji for light (å…‰ hikari). You will obtain Bahamut after
              completing the Cloister of Trials in Bevelle Temple.

              Bahamut possesses the auto-ability Break Damage Barrier. This
              enables its attacks to exceed 9999 HP damage right from the start.
              Bahamut has high strength, defense and magic attributes. Bahamut's
              regular attack causes more damage than any other aeon's. Bahamut
              can also cast the highest elemental black magic spells. His unique
              attack is Impulse where he charges up four balls of dark magic and
              hurls them, damaging all enemies. Impulse is especially useful
              when fighting multiple opponents.

              Bahamut is the most powerful of the aeons. His overdrive is Mega
              Flare, a classic attack for this character. Bahamut anchors itself
              and fires a destructive breath attack that annihilates anything in
              its path. Bahamut's overdrive consistently deals over 9999 HP
              damage to all enemies, and it will continue to grow stronger. He
              is capable of exceeding the 9999 damage limit from the start.
