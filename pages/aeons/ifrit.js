              Ifrit is a humannoid, demonic-looking beast fire elemental aeon.
              He has reddish brown complexion with fire red hair. He is bulky
              and hunch backed. According to the writing on its statue
              illustration, Ifrit's fayth was a twenty-five year old young man
              named Edmundo. Edmundo was a former Crusader whose statue resides
              in the Kilika Temple. The symbol for Ifrit and Kilika is annotated
              with the kanji for flame (ç‚Ž honoo). You have to complete a
              Cloister of Trials in the Kilika Temple to obtain Ifrit for your
              party.

              Ifrit has incredibly high strength in exchange for low defense and
              magic defense. He also has lower HP but can self heal by casting
              fire upon himself and will absorb any fire attacks casted upon
              him. His unique attack is Meteor Strike, a non-elemental attack
              that is hurled at one enemy, but has a longer recovery time that
              his regular attack. The firey rock he throws will be aimed at a
              single target. This is a useful long-range attack. It also
              penetrates protect spells despite being a physical attack. Ifrit
              is also protected against instant death and all negative status
              effect, except for Curse and Eject.

              Ifrit has armor equiped, even though it is not mentioned in game.
              This armor has Sensor, Break HP Limit, Break MP Limit and Fire
              Eater. Ifrit's Overdrive is Hellfire, this attack encases its foes
              in a swirling ball of fiery vengeance and detonates it for massive
              damage to all enemies. All of Ifrit's attacks can reach the 9999
              damage limit when you activate Wakka's legendary weapon, World
              Champion. Ifrit will also gain Break Damage Limit after obtaining
              World Champion.
