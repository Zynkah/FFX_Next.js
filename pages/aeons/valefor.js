              An avian aeon with great dragon-like wings. Her fayth statue is
              located in Besaid Temple and is a teenage girl. She is a
              non-elemental aerial aeon, her symbol from the Yevon Script is the
              kanji for nothing (ç„¡ mu), but nothingness may also be associated
              with the element of air. Mu is a Zen Buddhist concept expressing
              negation of the self, selflessness, innocence and the purity of
              soul. These are traits a summoner must achieve to succeed in
              defeating Sin, since self sacrifice to the Eternal Calm is
              required. She is Yuna's first aeon.

              This aerial aeon easily dodges many attacks from the ground.
              Valefor's regular attack is a quick, snatching motion, which is
              enhanced by the aeon's high accuracy. Unlike other aeons,
              Valeforis unique in not having the Piercing auto-ability, and also
              has a slightly lower attack power. The unique attack is Sonic
              Wings, and attack that sends a shockwave at one enemy, inflicting
              damage and delaying the enemy's next turn. Because of the delay
              effect and short recovery time, you can often hit enemies
              repeatedly with Sonic Wings.

              The Overdrive attack is Energy Ray which fires a super-charged
              beam that explodes underneath all the foes and causes
              non-elemental damage. There is a second secret overdrive for
              Valefor as well. You obtain this all you have to do is return to
              Besaid and speak to a little girl with a dog standing next to the
              temple. You will receive an item that gives Valefor the Overdrive
              energy blast. If the little girl is not in by the temple then look
              for her in the item shop. Energy blast inflicts greater damage at
              the cost of higher recovery time. Once Yuna activates her ultimate
              weapon, Nirvana, all of Valefor's attacks can break the 9999
              damage limit.
