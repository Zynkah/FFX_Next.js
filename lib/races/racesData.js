        "The Fayth are humans who willingly had their souls sealed in statues in a state of dreaming in Spira. A ritual that removes their souls from their still living bodies are sealed into stone tablets. This technique of creating Fayth's was used in Zanarkand. Their powers allow a summoner to coalesce the power of pyreflies to create physical forms of the Fayth's dream, called Aeons, or other magical phenomena. Aeons are the physical realization of the Fayth's dreams. The fayth's aeon form is the physical embodiment of the fayth itself. Aeons usually embody the fayth's strongest emotion, for example Anima's pain and sorrow. The Fayth communicate with summoners who pray to them within the Chambers of the Fayth, and establish a mental link between the Fayth and the summoner. Using this link, the fayth gives their dream a physical form: an Aeon. Aeons are powerful creatures only a summoner can use in battle. Most aeons resemble their respective fayth, so it can be assumes the aeon takes on aspects of the person whose soul is sealed inside the fayth statue. Many summoner can communicate with any one fayth to establish a mental link with them, enabling them to then summon the fayth's aeon, but only one summoner can call on a particular fayth's power at any one time. This is why during the aeon duels two of the same aeon cannot battle one another, Dark Aeons are an exception to this rule.",
