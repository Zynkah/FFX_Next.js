This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  `npm run dev`
    Starts the development server.

  `npm run build`
    Builds the app for production.

  `npm start`
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd nextjs-blog
  `npm run dev`# Next.js
